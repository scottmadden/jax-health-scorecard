## 📰 Press Release Template

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Jacksonville-Area School Health Readiness Scorecard Launched**  
*Automated tool ranks 93 schools on 5 federal health indicators with daily updates*

**Jacksonville, FL – November 9, 2025** – A new, freely accessible school health readiness scorecard is now available for Jacksonville-area schools, providing data-driven insights for resource allocation and health program prioritization.

The scorecard, developed by Scott Madden and available at scottmadden.github.io/jax-health-scorecard, ranks 93 public schools across Duval, Clay, St. Johns, Nassau, and Baker counties using five evidence-based health indicators:

- Primary care access (HRSA data)
- Chronic disease prevalence (CDC PLACES tract-level data)
- Air quality (EPA AirData)
- Natural hazard risk (FEMA National Risk Index)
- Respiratory virus activity (CDC surveillance)

**Key Findings:**

"Our analysis reveals significant health disparities at the school level," said Madden. "Chronic disease prevalence varies by 63% within Duval County alone—from 19.3% to 31.5%—showing that county-level data masks critical differences between neighborhoods."

The scorecard identifies Darnell-Cookman School of the Medical Arts and Lavilla School of the Arts (both in Duval County) as having the highest health needs, with readiness scores of 48.5 out of 100. Nassau County schools consistently scored lowest (15-16 range), indicating better overall health conditions.

**Automated & Transparent:**

The system updates automatically every day using publicly available federal data sources, requiring no manual data entry. All methodology and source code are open source and available on GitHub.

"School administrators can use this tool to justify wellness program funding, prioritize school nurse placement, and track health improvements over time," Madden added. "The tract-level granularity enables targeted interventions at specific schools rather than broad county-wide programs."

**About the Tool:**

- Updates: Daily at 9:15am ET
- Cost: Free (zero infrastructure costs)
- Data Sources: CDC, EPA, HRSA, FEMA (all public)
- Coverage: 93 schools (38 elementary, 13 middle, 42 high)
- Technology: Python, GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages

## 📞 Cold Call Script

"Hi [Name], this is Scott Madden. I've built a school health readiness scorecard for Jacksonville that I think could help your district make data-driven decisions about resource allocation.

[PAUSE for response]

It ranks all 93 major K-12 schools in the Jacksonville area on 5 federal health indicators—things like chronic disease prevalence at the census tract level, healthcare access, and air quality.

For example, it shows that chronic disease varies by 63% within Duval County, from 19% to 31% depending on the school's neighborhood. That level of precision helps you know exactly which schools need school nurses or wellness programs most urgently.

The system updates daily and pulls from CDC, EPA, and other federal sources—all free public data. Would you have 15 minutes this week for me to show you the tool and discuss how it might support your health initiatives?"
